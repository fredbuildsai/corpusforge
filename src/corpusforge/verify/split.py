"""Stage 9 (Verify): assign a deterministic train/eval split, by paper.

Splitting must happen at the *document* level, not per-example: several QA/negative/ideation rows can come
from the same paper, and letting some of a paper's rows land in eval while others train on the same source
text would leak information across the split. Each document's `doc_id` hashes to a stable train/eval
assignment, then every derived row (QA, Ideation, Negative, DPOPair, ClaimPair) inherits its source
document's split at export time (see `export.unsloth_jsonl`).
