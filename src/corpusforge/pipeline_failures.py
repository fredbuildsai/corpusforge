"""Roll up every kind of pipeline failure back to the document level, in one place.

Two distinct failure sources exist and neither alone answers "which documents need attention":
- `bg fetch-failures` already covers documents `bg fetch` never got full text for (see `fetch.py`).
- Every annotate/generate/judge stage records its own per-chunk/per-row failures as `GenTask` rows with
  `status="failed"` (see `annotate.tasks`), keyed by a stage-specific id - a chunk_id for extract/generate
  tasks, but a QA-id or Ideation-id (`"<chunk_id>#qa<N>"` / `"<chunk_id>#idea"`) for judge/dpo tasks, since
  those operate on already-generated rows rather than raw chunks.

`resolve_chunk_id` undoes that: it tries the full remainder as a chunk_id first (the common case), and falls
back to stripping the last `#`-segment for the qa/idea-keyed tasks. This is a document-level view, so multiple
failed chunks/rows for the same document collapse into one entry with all of that document's failures listed.
