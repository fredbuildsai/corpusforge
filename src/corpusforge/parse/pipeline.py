    chunk rows, well enough to re-run `chunk_sections` at a different `target_tokens`/`max_tokens`
    without re-parsing the original PDF/XML file at all.

    Each chunk after the first in its section stores an overlap prefix that must be stripped first
    (see `strip_overlap_prefix`) - failing to strip it would duplicate text at every old chunk
    boundary in the reconstructed section. Chunks are grouped by their full `section_path` (distinct
    subsections stay distinct Section objects, matching how they were originally parsed) and ordered
    within a group by `order`, which is a global, monotonically increasing sequence number for the
    whole document - confirmed against real chunk_ids - so the resulting section order (by each
    group's minimum `order`) reproduces the document's real original section sequence.

    Paragraph boundaries are approximated: the original chunking joined paragraph-level units with
    "\\n\\n" before splitting into chunks, so re-splitting the reconstructed text on "\\n\\n" recovers
    something functionally equivalent for re-chunking purposes, even though exact original
    paragraph-by-paragraph fidelity isn't guaranteed to survive a round trip through chunking.
    Captions/images (stored only on each section's first chunk originally) are carried over from
    each group's first chunk - `caption_images` is reconstructed as a single group holding all of
    that chunk's flattened image filenames, since the original per-caption alignment isn't preserved
    once flattened into `Chunk.images`.
