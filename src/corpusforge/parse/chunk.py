"""Section-aware chunking with a small sentence overlap and real tokenizer counts.

Chunks never cross section boundaries (the previous trial's chunks spanned chapters and repeated about half
of the previous chunk). Paragraphs are packed up to `target_tokens`; a paragraph longer than `max_tokens` is
split by sentences. Each chunk after the first in a section starts with trailing sentences of the previous
chunk totalling at most `overlap_tokens`.
